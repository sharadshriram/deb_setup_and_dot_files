### Fish Config

The config also includes the `bobthefish` theme that is installed by copying the `.fish` scripts to the `functions` directory. 

The config also has some utility functions borrowed from [razzius/fish-functions](https://github.com/razzius/fish-functions). 
Some of the aliases are borrowed from [dwt1/dotfiles/.config](https://gitlab.com/dwt1/dotfiles/-/tree/master/.config)
